The code causes an infinite loop because the code inside the while loop's condition doesn't check for equality; rather, it is an assignment operator which keeps resetting the value of counter to 1 upon each iteration. The return value of the assignment operation is 1, which is truthy, so it keeps running. And since counter is reset each time to 1, the break keyword will never run, either.
