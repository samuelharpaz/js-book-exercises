The program will log 'bar' to the console, which references the foo variable that was declared outside of the block. The foo variable inside the block creates an entirely new variable, which shadows the outer foo variable inside the block. But the foo variable inside the block is not accessible from outside the block, and therefore when we try to reference foo outside the block, it references the outer foo, not the inner one.
