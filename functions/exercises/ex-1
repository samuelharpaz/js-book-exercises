The code will log 1. Executing the foo function will not affect the output, because inside the foo function, bar is declared with let, not reassigned. Therefore, that variable declaration is a separate entity from the global bar variable, and does not affect it in any way. On the last line, when we log the value of the bar variable, we are referencing the global bar, and not the local bar variable inside the foo function (which is out of scope).
